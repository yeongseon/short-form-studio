# Run storage update contract

The in-memory and PostgreSQL run adapters share these boundaries:

- `update_run` accepts only columns in `UPDATABLE_RUN_COLUMNS`. Storage-owned
  columns (`id`, `version`, `project_id`, `workspace_id`) and unknown columns
  are rejected with `ValueError`. An empty patch is a workspace-scoped read that
  checks `expected_version` when provided; it never advances the version. A
  stale version returns `None`.
- `conditional_update_run` also rejects storage-owned and unknown columns. An
  empty patch reads the scoped run, accepts only an expected stage that is not
  in `rejected_statuses`, and does not advance the version. A missing or
  out-of-workspace run returns `(False, None)`.
- Nonempty accepted patches advance the version once. Callers that require a
  version change must supply an actual field update; an empty patch does not
  acquire an exclusive claim or atomically reserve a later update.

`RunService` stage transitions, dispatch CAS, and worker outcome transitions
submit nonempty patches. These contracts are exercised against both adapters,
including a disposable migrated PostgreSQL schema, in
`packages/creator-service/tests/test_run_adapter_parity.py`.

## Media upload ownership and reconciliation

Every workspace media upload has a durable `creator_media_upload_intents` row
before object I/O. Its `owner_id` identifies one attempt; `workspace_id` and the
workspace-prefixed `storage_key` bind that attempt to exactly one object. Future
quota work may consume this ownership API, but reconciliation does not account
or enforce upload budgets.

States and terminal policy:

- `pending` owns a key before upload; process death leaves it for reclamation
  only after its lease expires.
- `uploaded` means object I/O completed while metadata is not yet confirmed.
- metadata success, including a registered key found after an indeterminate
  commit acknowledgement, transitions to terminal `completed`; it is never
  deleted by reconciliation. This also preserves Timeline-referenced media
  because Timeline references resolve through persisted `MediaAsset` rows.
- validation failure occurs before intent/object creation and leaves no durable
  upload state. Cancellation before upload leaves `pending`; cancellation after
  upload is shielded through metadata completion. A hard process death at either
  point converges through the expired lease.
- a definite metadata rollback triggers compensation. Successful deletion ends
  in terminal `reclaimed`; a delete failure remains `cleanup_pending`.
- cleanup retries are bounded. Exhausted records end in terminal `exhausted`
  for operator action and remain durable rather than losing ownership evidence.

Sweepers claim expired rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, verify a same-workspace
`creator_media_assets.storage_key` reference before deleting, and update terminal
state idempotently. Ambiguous outcomes favor preservation: no object is deleted
until the lease expires and registration has been checked by exact key.
