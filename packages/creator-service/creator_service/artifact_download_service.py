        3. **Commit** (short transaction): DELETE successful rows from
           the DB, UPDATE failures with error metadata, and mark rows
           that have exhausted all retries as abandoned.

        Also picks up *stranded* rows — those with ``delete_requested_at``

        delete succeeded but before the DB row was removed).
